## Multi-Agent Customer Service
This is my very first project experimenting with agents, where I imagine myself as the seller of homemade cookies 🍪. The idea is simple: instead of answering every customer one by one, I let the agents handle customer service automatically. That way, even if many people ask about policies, how to place an order, or need some menu consultation at the same time, no one has to wait too long for a reply.
